	I am a recent graduate from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a major in Computer Science and a double minor in Physics and Mathematics.  I am looking to move forward in my career by becoming a software developer.  Some of my interests are mobile app development (iOS/Android), database management (SQL, MSSQLServer), software engineering (Java, C#, C++), and web development (HTML/CSS/PHP).

	One of my proudest projects is a mobile application, Ketch, that facilitates buyers and sellers in a local marketplace. This app was developed using XCode/Swift and the link to the Github repository can be found <a href = https://github.com/Patspalace/Ketch>here</a>.
